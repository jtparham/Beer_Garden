        Use the filters to sort through our vast selection! Here's a tip to make sure you get the best user experience:
        <pre>
            1.  Use the filters! The filters allow you to look up all sorts of cool information about our selection.
                For example, if you know you like stouts, but want a higher A.B.V, type "Stout" in the "Style" filter.
                Then click the icon under the A.B.V column and select "Greater than or equal to". This will show you all the
                stouts that have an A.B.V greater than 10%!

            2.  Want to read the full description? Click the dropdown arrow and you'll expand that row to see the entire description. 
                Click again to collapse the row.

            3.  Another tip on filters, you can specify how you want your search terms to be filtered. Can't remember the exact name of
                what you're looking for? No worries! You can search for partial terms so long as you select the "Contains" option from the
                filter icon. If you click the icon next to the Filter section, you'll see there are many ways to filter whether its inclusive,
                exclusive, exact matches, and more! Don't worry about upper/lower case, as the filter handles that for you.
                
            4.  Last tip, enjoy the beer!
